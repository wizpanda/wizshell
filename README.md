> At [Wiz Panda](https://www.wizpanda.com/) we believe in saving time. **Although in seconds, but matters!**
 
This repository containing necessary & useful shell scripts & bash aliases which we use on day to day life as software engineer & 
developers.

This shell tool assumes that you keep all your repositories in a common directory which is termed as **your work directory**

## Installation

Before using wizshell for the first time, you need to set it up, **which is a few liner**:

```bash
export WORK_DIRECTORY=/path/to/all/git/repositories
source ${WORK_DIRECTORY}/wizshell/wiz.sh
```

Add the above line either in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and reload it by `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` or open a new 
terminal to put the wizshell in effect.
